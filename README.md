The program solves numerically the problem of optimization of given linear functional (see ./theory for more information).

Numerical methods include: 
1. The calculation of integral using Simpson formula;
2. The integration of a system of differential equations using Runge-Kutta method with 6 steps;
3. The modified Newton method for the search of unknown boundary conditions of forementioned system.
